## üéØ Goal

Find customers who **visited the mall** but did **not make any transactions**, and count how many times this occurred for each customer.

## ‚úÖ Solution

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t
ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE t.visit_id IS NULL
GROUP BY (customer_id)


--Another way
/*
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
WHERE NOT EXISTS(
    SELECT 1 
    FROM Transactions t
    WHERE v.visit_id = t.visit_id
)
GROUP BY customer_id
*/

--Another way
/*
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
WHERE visit_id NOT IN(
    SELECT visit_id 
    FROM Transactions t
    WHERE v.visit_id = t.visit_id
)
GROUP BY customer_id
*/
