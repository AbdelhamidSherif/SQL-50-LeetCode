## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Find how many times each student attended each exam.

- You must return all possible combinations of students and subjects.
- Output should include:
  - `student_id`
  - `student_name`
  - `subject_name`
  - `attended_exams`
- The result should be ordered by `student_id` and `subject_name`.

---

## ðŸ§  Approach

- Use a `CROSS JOIN` between `Students` and `Subjects` to get all student-subject pairs.
- Use a `LEFT JOIN` with `Examinations` to count how many times each student took each subject.
- Use `GROUP BY` and `COUNT()` to calculate the attendance count per pair.

FROM Students St
CROSS JOIN Subjects Su
LEFT JOIN Examinations Ex
ON Su.subject_name = Ex.subject_name AND 
St.student_id = Ex.student_id
GROUP BY
  St.student_id, 
  St.student_name, 
  Su.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id,
