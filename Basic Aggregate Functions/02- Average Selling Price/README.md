## üéØ Goal

Calculate the **average selling price** for each product using the formula:

Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.

- Match sales to the correct price based on the **purchase date falling within a price period**.
- Round the final `average_price` to **two decimal places**.
- If a product has no sales, the average price is **0**.

## ‚úÖ Solution

```sql
SELECT p.product_id,
       COALESCE(ROUND(SUM(u.units * p.price * 1.0) / SUM(u.units), 2), 0) AS average_price
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
ON p.product_id = u.product_id AND purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id;
